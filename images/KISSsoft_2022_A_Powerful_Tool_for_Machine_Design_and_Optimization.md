KISSsoft is compatible with most CAD systems and can import and export data in various formats. It also has a built-in programming language that allows users to customize the software and add their own calculation methods and solutions. KISSsoft can be used as a standalone program or as an integrated module in KISSsys or GPK.
 
KISSsys is an extension of KISSsoft that enables users to create models of complex systems, such as gearboxes, transmissions, drives, etc. It can perform system-level analysis and optimization of all the components in the system. KISSsys also has a web-based version called KISSsysWeb that allows users to access the software from any device with an internet connection.
 
GPK is another extension of KISSsoft that focuses on industrial gearbox design and optimization. It can generate variants of typical gearbox models and compare their performance and costs. It can also perform detailed analysis of the gearbox components and their interactions.
 
KISSsoft 2022 is the latest version of the software that was released in March 2023. It has many new features and improvements, such as:
 
- A new module for calculating the efficiency of gear pairs and gearboxes
- A new module for performing modal analysis of shafts and gears
- A new feature for considering the housing deformation in the calculation of gear meshing
- A new feature for calculating the reliability of machine elements based on statistical data
- Improved user interface and graphics
- Updated standards and methods for various machine elements
- And more...

If you are interested in learning more about KISSsoft 2022 or downloading a free trial version, you can visit their official website[^1^] or follow them on SoundCloud[^2^] [^3^]. You can also read some reviews and testimonials from their customers on their website or on other platforms[^4^]. KISSsoft 2022 is a powerful tool that can help you design and optimize your machine elements and gearboxes with ease and confidence.

KISSsoft 2022 is not only a powerful tool for machine design and optimization, but also a user-friendly and modern software that keeps up with the latest trends and standards in the industry. It has a new and improved user interface that makes it easier to navigate and access the various modules and functions. It also has enhanced graphics and reports that provide clear and comprehensive visualization and documentation of the results.
 
KISSsoft 2022 also incorporates the latest standards and methods for different types of machine elements, such as ISO 6336-3 (extended) for gear tooth root fatigue strength, ISO 6336-5 (extended) for gear flank load capacity, ISO 281 for bearing life modification factor, ISO 6336-6 for planetary gears, etc. It also supports various methods for calculating the influence of flank waviness on transmission error, such as ISO/TR 15144-1, AGMA 2000-A88, DIN 3967, etc.
 
KISSsoft 2022 is not only a standalone software, but also a part of a larger ecosystem that includes KISSsys, GPK, KISSsysWeb, KISSdesigner, KISSsoft Interface for ANSYS Workbench, KISSsoft Interface for MATLAB/Simulink, etc. These products allow users to integrate KISSsoft with other software and platforms and perform advanced analysis and optimization of complex systems and applications. Some examples of KISSsoft projects are:

- Design and optimization of a planetary gearbox for a wind turbine[^1^]
- Design and optimization of a spur gear pair for a power tool[^1^]
- Design and optimization of a bevel gear pair for a helicopter[^1^]
- Design and optimization of a worm gear pair for a conveyor belt[^1^]
- Design and optimization of a cylindrical roller bearing for a pump[^1^]
